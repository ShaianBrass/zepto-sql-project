# üõí SQL Data Analysis Project ‚Äì E-Commerce Inventory (Zepto Dataset)

## üìå Project Overview
This project simulates how data analysts in e-commerce/retail use SQL to work with **messy real-world data**.  
Using **PostgreSQL**, I explored, cleaned, and analyzed a Zepto product dataset to extract **business-driven insights** around pricing, inventory, and revenue.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview
- **Source:** Kaggle ‚Äì Zepto Products Dataset  
- **Rows:** ~3,452 product SKUs (rows may vary depending on version)  
- **Columns:**
  - `sku_id` ‚Äì Unique product identifier  
  - `name` ‚Äì Product name  
  - `category` ‚Äì Product category (Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.)  
  - `mrp` ‚Äì Maximum Retail Price (‚Çπ, converted from paise)  
  - `discountPercent` ‚Äì Discount applied  
  - `discountedSellingPrice` ‚Äì Final price after discount (‚Çπ)  
  - `availableQuantity` ‚Äì Units available in inventory  
  - `weightInGms` ‚Äì Product weight in grams  
  - `outOfStock` ‚Äì Stock status (boolean)  
  - `quantity` ‚Äì Package count

## üîß Project Workflow
1. **Database Setup** ‚Äì Created PostgreSQL table with appropriate datatypes.  
2. **Data Import** ‚Äì Imported CSV dataset (handled UTF-8 encoding issues).  
3. **Data Exploration** ‚Äì Checked record counts, nulls, duplicates, stock distribution.  
4. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Removed invalid rows (zero pricing), converted paise ‚Üí rupees.  
5. **Business Insights** ‚Äì Wrote SQL queries to answer real business questions.

## üìä Key SQL Queries & Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Best-Value Products
```
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountedSellingPrice, discountPercent
FROM zepto
ORDER BY discountPercent DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Identifies products with maximum customer savings.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ High MRP but Out-of-Stock Products
```
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, outOfStock
FROM zepto
WHERE outOfStock = true
ORDER BY mrp DESC;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Useful for demand analysis & restocking decisions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Estimated Revenue by Category
```
SELECT category, SUM(discountedSellingPrice * availableQuantity) AS Estimated_Revenue
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY Estimated_Revenue DESC;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Helps prioritize high-revenue categories.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Premium Products with Low Discounts
```
SELECT DISTINCT name, mrp, discountPercent 
FROM zepto
WHERE mrp > 500 AND discountPercent < 10
ORDER BY mrp DESC, discountPercent DESC;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Finds premium products with weak offers.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Categories by Avg. Discount
```
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(discountPercent),2) AS average_discount_percentage
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY average_discount_percentage DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Shows categories offering the best deals.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Price per Gram (Value-for-Money Check)
```
SELECT DISTINCT name, ROUND(discountedSellingPrice/weightInGms,2) AS price_per_gram
FROM zepto
WHERE weightInGms >= 100
ORDER BY price_per_gram ASC;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Helps compare true cost efficiency.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Product Weight Categorization
```
SELECT DISTINCT name, weightInGms,
CASE WHEN weightInGms < 1000 THEN 'Low'
     WHEN weightInGms < 5000 THEN 'Medium'
     ELSE 'Bulk' END AS weight_category
FROM zepto;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Classifies products into Low, Medium, Bulk packs.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Total Inventory Weight per Category
```
SELECT category, SUM(weightInGms * availableQuantity) AS total_inventory_weight_per_category
FROM zepto
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_inventory_weight_per_category DESC;
```
‚úîÔ∏è Useful for logistics & warehouse planning.
